# Security Changes

## Overview

This document outlines the security changes made to the Spotify Clone project to properly secure sensitive configuration and API tokens.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Environment Variables Implementation

- Created a `.env` file for all sensitive configuration
- Configured dotenv to load environment variables
- Removed all hardcoded API tokens and secrets from the codebase
- Added `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits

### 2. Secure Configuration Management

#### ChatbotService
- Removed hardcoded Astra DB token
- Moved Astra API URL and token to environment variables
- Added proper validation of configuration 

#### Authentication System
- Removed hardcoded JWT secret
- Added validation to ensure JWT_SECRET is defined
- Improved error handling for missing environment variables

#### Database Connection
- Configured database connection to use environment variables
- Added fallbacks for development to ease setup

#### Google OAuth
- Conditional setup of Google OAuth strategy based on environment configuration
- Improved error reporting for missing configuration

### 3. Documentation

- Created a README.md file with security best practices
- Added detailed setup instructions for environment variables
- Documented token security requirements

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` files** to version control
2. **Never hardcode credentials** directly in source code
3. **Validate environment variables** at application startup
4. Use different tokens for development and production environments
5. Regularly rotate security credentials
6. Implement proper error handling for configuration issues

## Future Recommendations

1. Implement a secure secret management system for production (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
2. Encrypt sensitive values in the database
3. Add IP restrictions to API access
4. Implement API rate limiting
5. Set up security monitoring and alerts
